Yet another MIPS processor simulator.

This simulator runs a subset of the little endian MIPS32 (MIPSEL)
specification.  Full compliance to the specification is a non-goal.

The goal is to be a multiprocessor simulator, then to implement COP2 to have
some transputer-like functionality.

To build the simulator:
	- Build dependencies: c99 compiler, POSIX compatible libc, elf.h
	  (installed via libelf on Linux) and err.h (installed via libbsd
	  on Linux)
	- check config.mk and, if needed, set compiler and flags to your liking
	- make
